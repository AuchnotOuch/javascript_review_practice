Javascript is a programming language of the web.

A framework is an abstraction on top of javascript.

Javascript is not the same as Java.

A programming language is a group of symbols/tokens that, when
combined, can be translated by a compiler into machine code.

A compiler is simply another program/code that translates other
code for a computer to understand.

Runtime is an environment where code executes. Javascript can run
in the backend via node.js as well as running in the frontend via the browser.
These runtimes utilize an engine, like V8, to run the code.
